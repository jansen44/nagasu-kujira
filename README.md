# NagasuKujira - 長須鯨

### About
Kujira鯨 aims to be an OSS solution for Kanban/Scrum stuff. It aims to be easy to run, develop, and build extensions.

### About - 長須鯨
NagasuKujira長須鯨 is part of the Kujira project as the main backend service. 長須鯨 (Fin Whales) are the fastest whales of the world, and this service aims to be the fastest service of the Kujira stack, so it makes sense (I guess).
