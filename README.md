# NagasuKujira - é•·é ˆé¯¨

### About
Kujiraé¯¨ aims to be an OSS solution for Kanban/Scrum stuff. It aims to be easy to run, develop, and build extensions. This mainly aims to help individuals that has a lot of different projects and can't just manage them (myself for instance), but this doesn't mean that it won't work for teams also ðŸ˜‰ 

### About - é•·é ˆé¯¨
NagasuKujiraé•·é ˆé¯¨ is part of the Kujira project as the main backend service. é•·é ˆé¯¨ (Fin Whales) are the fastest whales of the world, and this service aims to be the fastest service of the Kujira stack, so it makes sense (I guess).

### é•·é ˆé¯¨ Roadmap
At first things may seem kinda simple, in general that's what I aim to do, but there are a lot of things I need/want to change in a near future.

You can check all roadmap and current development status on our [Github Project](https://github.com/jansen44/nagasu-kujira/projects/1)

### Running é•·é ˆé¯¨
Before running, you need to satisfy the selected driver and selected storage dependencies. 
Currently, there is only one driver (RestAPI Server) and one storage (MySQL). 
- RestAPI Server works as is, you can set the default listening port with some flags.
- For MySQL Storage you need one MySQL server running with a database called ```nagasu```. 
  - Now it's only able to run the server locally, but feel free to edit ```infra/repositories.go (line 13)``` to connect to a remote server. I intend to add a flag to set this in a near future, so don't worry about it.
- You also need to run database migrations before running... Or you can just add a ```-migrate``` flag and it will work as it was supposed to.

```bash
go run main.go -migrate -restPort=3030 -storage=mysql -driver=rest
```
The above command runs Nagasu with automatic storage migrations, using MySQL as storage and running a RestAPI Server (listening on port ```3030```).
